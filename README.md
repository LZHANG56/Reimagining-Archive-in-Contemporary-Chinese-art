# Reimagining Archive in Contemporary Chinese Art 

Reimagining Archive in Contemporary Chinese Art  is a comprehensive digital collection showcasing the engagement of contemporary Chinese artists with archival materials, spanning from 1978 to the present. Curated by Luming Zhang as part of the LIS program at CollectionBuilder, this project features artworks from China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, offering a unique insight into the artistic evolution and cultural narratives of the region.

## Brief Overview of Building the Collection

The [CollectionBuilder Docs](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/) provide detailed information on building a collection from start to finish, including software installation, GitHub setup, digital object preparation, and metadata formatting. However, here's a quick overview:

- **Use the Template:** Make a copy of this template repository by clicking the green "Use this Template" button on GitHub. This repository serves as the foundation for your digital collection site.
- **Prepare Metadata:** Follow the CB-CSV template to prepare your collection metadata. The metadata should include links to digital files (images, pdfs, videos, etc.) and thumbnails hosted wherever necessary.
- **Upload Metadata:** Add your metadata as a CSV file to the "_data" folder in your project repository.
- **Configure Site:** Edit the "_config.yml" file with your collection information. Additional customization can be done via theme files, configuration files, CSS tweaks, etc.
- **Generate Site:** Use Jekyll to generate your site locally. Refer to the documentation for instructions on local setup and web deployment.

## About CollectionBuilder

[CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/) is a project developed by the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Initiatives](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/) and the [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu), following the [Lib-Static](https://lib-static.github.io/) methodology. Powered by Jekyll and a modern static web stack, CollectionBuilder transforms collection metadata into visually engaging websites.

The basic theme is created using Bootstrap, with metadata visualizations built using open source libraries such as DataTables, Leafletjs, Spotlight gallery, lazysizes, and Lunr.js. Object metadata is exposed using Schema.org and Open Graph protocol standards.

## About the Project

"Reimagining Archive in Contemporary Chinese Art" is a comprehensive digital collection showcasing the engagement of contemporary Chinese artists with archival materials, spanning from 1978 to the present. This project features artworks from China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, offering unique insights into the artistic evolution and cultural narratives of the region.

Curated by Luming Zhang as part of the LIS program at the University of Washington, this digital endeavor serves as a bridge connecting historical perspectives with contemporary interpretations.

## Curator's Statement

As the curator, Luming Zhang, I have carefully selected the pieces that resonate with the rich cultural heritage and the evolving identity of Chinese art. Through this collection, we invite viewers to delve into the complexities and narratives that these archival materials bring to light.

## Technical Credits - CollectionBuilder

This digital collection is built with CollectionBuilder, an open-source tool for creating digital collection and exhibit websites. Utilizing the CollectionBuilder-CSV template, this project is powered by the static website generator Jekyll, allowing for a visually engaging and metadata-driven interface to explore our collection.
